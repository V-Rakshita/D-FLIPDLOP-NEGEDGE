# D-FLIPDLOP-NEGEDGE

## **AIM:**

To implement  D flipflop using verilog and validating their functionality using their functional tables

## **SOFTWARE REQUIRED:**

Quartus prime

## **THEORY**

## **D Flip-Flop**

D flip-flop operates with only positive clock transitions or negative clock transitions. Whereas, D latch operates with enable signal. That means, the output of D flip-flop is insensitive to the changes in the input, D except for active transition of the clock signal. The circuit diagram of D flip-flop is shown in the following figure.

This circuit has single input D and two outputs Qtt & Qttâ€™. The operation of D flip-flop is similar to D Latch. But, this flip-flop affects the outputs only when positive transition of the clock signal is applied instead of active enable. The following table shows the state table of D flip-flop.

Therefore, D flip-flop always Hold the information, which is available on data input, D of earlier positive transition of clock signal. From the above state table, we can directly write the next state equation as Qt+1t+1 = D

Next state of D flip-flop is always equal to data input, D for every positive transition of the clock signal. Hence, D flip-flops can be used in registers, shift registers and some of the counters.

## **Procedure**

1.	Open Quartus and go to File -> New Project Wizard to create a new project. 

2.	Then, Go to File -> New -> Verilog HDL File and type the program. Compile and run the program.

3.	Then go to Tools -> NetList Viewers -> RTL Viewer and generate the RTL schematic and save the logic diagram.

4.	Then go to File -> New -> University program VWF. Create nodes for inputs and outputs to generate the timing diagram.

5.	Give different input combinations and go to Run Functional Simulation to generate the timing diagram.
